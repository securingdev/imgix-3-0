**This documentation is for imgix.js version `3.0.0` and up. Those using imgix.js `2.x.x` can find documentation in that version's [readme](https://github.com/imgix/imgix.js/tree/2.2.3) and [API reference](https://github.com/imgix/imgix.js/blob/2.2.3/docs/api.md).**

**Note:** If you're looking for a Javascript library just to generate imgix URLs, check out [imgix-core-js](https://github.com/imgix/imgix-core-js).


imgix.js allows developers to easily generate responsive images using the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes, or the `picture` element. This lets you write a single image URL that is parsed and used to make images look great at any screen size, by using [imgix](https://imgix.com) to process and resize your images on the fly.

Responsive images in the browser, simplified. Pure JavaScript with zero dependencies. About 2 KB minified and gzipped.

## Overview / Resources

**Before you get started with imgix.js**, it's _highly recommended_ that you read Eric Portis' [seminal article on `srcset` and `sizes`](https://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/). This article explains the history of responsive images in responsive design, why they're necessary, and how all these technologies work together to save bandwidth and provide a better experience for users. The primary goal of imgix.js is to make these tools easier for developers to implement, so having an understanding of how they work will significantly improve your imgix.js experience.

Below are some other articles that help explain responsive imagery, and how it can work alongside imgix:

* [Using imgix with `<picture>`](https://docs.imgix.com/tutorials/using-imgix-picture-element). Discusses the differences between art direction and resolution switching, and provides examples of how to accomplish art direction with imgix.
* [Responsive Images with `srcset` and imgix](https://docs.imgix.com/tutorials/responsive-images-srcset-imgix). A look into how imgix can work with `srcset` and `sizes` to serve the right image.


<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation

There are several ways to install imgix.js. The appropriate method depends on your project.

1. **npm**: `npm install --save imgix.js`
2. **Bower**: `bower install --save imgix.js`
3. **Manual**: [Download the latest release of imgix.js](https://github.com/imgix/imgix.js/releases/latest), and use `dist/imgix.js` or `dist/imgix.min.js`.

After you've included imgix.js on your page, it will automatically run once, after the `DOMContentLoaded` event fires. This will detect and process all `img` and `source` tags on the page that are set up to use imgix.js as described in the [Usage](#usage) section of this README.

imgix.js has a few global options:

* `host`: Your imgix hostname (defaults to `null`). This enables the use of `ix-path` and `ix-params` to define images, instead of having to manually type URLs out in `imgix-src`. This has several advantages:
  1. `ix-params` automatically URL/Base64-encodes your specified parameters, as appropriate.
  2. `ix-params` is a JSON string, which is easier to read than a URL and can be generated by other tools if necessary.
  3. Not having to re-type `https://my-source.imgix.net` helps keep your code DRY.
* `useHttps`: A boolean (defaults to `true`), specifying whether to generate `http` or `https`-prefixed URLs.

These options can be defined in two ways. The first is to set them manually on the global `imgix.config` object:

``` html
<script src="imgix.js"></script>
<script>
  // Specify your imgix host. For these docs, we'll use `assets.imgix.net`.
  imgix.config.host = 'assets.imgix.net';
  // Optionally disable HTTPS image URL generation (defaults to `true`).
  imgix.config.useHttps = false;
</script>
```

The other option for setting global configuration options is to specify them with `meta` tags in your document's `head`. If present, these values will be detected just before the initial `DOMContentLoaded` call to `imgix.init()`:

``` html
<head>
  <meta property="ix:host" content="assets.imgix.net">
  <meta property="ix:useHttps" content="true">
</head>
```


<a name="usage"></a>
## Usage

Now that everything's installed and set up, you can start adding responsive images to the page. There are a few ways to do this.

<a name="ix-src"></a>
### `ix-src`

The simplest way to use imgix.js is to create an `img` tag with the `ix-src` attribute:

``` html
<img
  ix-src="https://assets.imgix.net/unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg?w=300&amp;h=500&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=right"
  alt="A hot air balloon on a sunny day"
>
```

This will generate HTML something like the following:

``` html
<img
  ix-src="https://assets.imgix.net/unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg?w=300&amp;h=500&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=right"
  alt="A hot air balloon on a sunny day"
  sizes="100vw"
  srcset="
    https://assets.imgix.net/unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg?w=100&amp;h=167&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=right 100w,
    https://assets.imgix.net/unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg?w=200&amp;h=333&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=right 200w,
    â€¦
    https://assets.imgix.net/unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=4267&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=right 2560w
  "
  src="https://assets.imgix.net/unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg?w=300&amp;h=500&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=right"
  ix-initialized="ix-initialized"
>
```

Since imgix can generate as many derivative resolutions as needed, imgix.js calculates them programmatically, using the dimensions you specify (note that the `w` and `h` params scale appropriately to maintain the correct aspect ratio). All of this information has been placed into the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes. Because of this, imgix.js no longer needs to watch or change the `img` tag, as all responsiveness will be handled automatically by the browser as the page is resized.


<a name="ix-path-and-ix-params"></a>
### `ix-path` and `ix-params`

Here's how the previous example would be written out using `ix-path` and `ix-params` instead of `ix-src`. Regardless of which method you choose, the end result in-browser will be the same.

**Please note**: `ix-params` must be a valid JSON string. This means that keys and string values must be surrounded by double quotes, e.g., `"fit": "crop"`.

``` html
<img
  ix-path="unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg"
  ix-params='{
    "w": 300,
    "h": 500,
    "fit": "crop",
    "crop": "right"
  }'
  alt="A hot air balloon on a sunny day"
>
```

<a name="picture-tags"></a>
### `picture` tags

If you need art-directed images, imgix.js plays nicely with the `picture` tag. This allows you to specify more advanced responsive images, by changing things such as the crop and aspect ratio for different screens. To get started, just construct a `picture` tag with a `source` attribute for each art-directed image, and a fallback `img` tag. If you're new to using the `picture` tag, you might want to check out our [tutorial](https://docs.imgix.com/tutorials/using-imgix-picture-element) to learn how it works.

The `source` tags can be used with `ix-src` or `ix-path` and `ix-params`, just like `img` tags. The following example will generate HTML that displays Bert _and_ Ernie on small screens, just Bert on medium-sized screens, and just Ernie on large screens.

``` html
<picture>
  <source
    media="(min-width: 880px)"
    sizes="430px"
    ix-path="imgixjs-demo-page/bertandernie.jpg"
    ix-params='{
      "w": 300,
      "h": 300,
      "fit": "crop",
      "crop": "left"
    }'
  >
  <source
    media="(min-width: 640px)"
    sizes="calc(100vw - 20px - 50%)"
    ix-path="imgixjs-demo-page/bertandernie.jpg"
    ix-params='{
      "w": 300,
      "h": 300,
      "fit": "crop",
      "crop": "right"
    }'
  >
  <source
    sizes="calc(100vw - 20px)"
    ix-path="imgixjs-demo-page/bertandernie.jpg"
    ix-params='{
      "w": 300,
      "h": 100,
      "fit": "crop"
    }'
  >
  <img ix-path="imgixjs-demo-page/bertandernie.jpg">
</picture>
```

<a name="advanced-usage"></a>
## Advanced Usage

<a name="manually-re-running-imgix-js"></a>
### Manually Re-running imgix.js

If you need to process `img` or `source` tags added after the initial page load (for example, on an infinite scrolling website or single-page application), you can simply call `imgix.init()`. By default, this is idempotent: `img` and `source` tags that have already been processed by imgix.js will not be re-initialized. If you would like to re-initialize _all_ imgix.js-formatted `img` and `source` tags, simply pass the `force: true` option: `imgix.init({force: true})`.

<a name="lazy-loading-with-lazysizes"></a>
### Lazy Loading With lazysizes

If you'd like to lazy load images, we recommend using [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes). In order to use imgix.js with lazysizes, you can simply tell it to generate lazysizes-compatible attributes instead of the standard `src`, `srcset`, and `sizes`:

``` javascript
imgix.init({
  srcAttribute: 'data-src',
  srcsetAttribute: 'data-srcset',
  sizesAttribute: 'data-sizes'
})
```

<a name="overriding-ix-host"></a>
### Overriding `ix-host`

If you need to display images from multiple imgix Sources, the `host` option can be overridden on any `img` or `source` tag by specifying an `ix-host` attribute in the tag:

``` html
<img
  ix-host="a-different-source.imgix.net"
  ix-path="unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg"
  ix-params='{
    "w": 300,
    "h": 500,
    "fit": "crop",
    "crop": "right"
  }'
  alt="A hot air balloon on a sunny day"
>
```


<a name="browser-support"></a>
## Browser Support

* By default, browsers that don't support [`srcset`](http://caniuse.com/#feat=srcset), [`sizes`](http://caniuse.com/#feat=srcset), or [`picture`](http://caniuse.com/#feat=picture) will gracefully fall back to the default `img` `src` when appropriate. If you want to provide a fully-responsive experience for these browsers, imgix.js works great alongside [Picturefill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill)!
* If you are using [Base64 variant params](https://docs.imgix.com/apis/url#base64-variants) and need IE <= 9 support, we recommend using a polyfill for `atob`/`btoa`, such as [Base64.js](https://github.com/davidchambers/Base64.js).
